    <p>Hello everyone, i am a 40year old gentleman married with 3 children from Botswana. I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day saints since 2004. i have served my mission in Uganda kampala mission from 2006 to 2008. One of my hobbies is to spend time with my family and is because they all love to watch cartoons and fun or comedy movies so i would spend all the time watching with them. Currently i am self employed. I do steel fabrication. I personally love anything to do with design either through computer or hands. </p>
    <p>My interest for web and computer programming began in 2012 when i worked for a certain security technology company, since then i have been trying to aquire more skills and knowledge so that it can be my profession but i wasnt affording to go to colledge because the course is so expensive. So, one thing i am greatful for in the church is pathway program, because of it my dream will come true. i am really happy to be part of this class and looking forward to learn from you all. i also enjoy watching soccer</p>
