      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to help people cut cost on their expenses since they have to pay transport fees, buy food on the way or fuel for them to travel 600km to buy an item that is 50% less than what they had spent just for tranportation.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My target audience is everyone that is residing far away from the city especially the villages, because in the city is where everything can be found and bought and it is disadvantage for those living outside since they have to pay more extra cash for them to be able to reach to the city and buy their products</p>  <!-- change this -->
